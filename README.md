<p><strong>Goal: is to build a simple hangman game that users can play via the terminal.</p></strong>

<p><strong>Your game must fulfill the following requirements.</p></strong>
<ul>
<li>You must choose a random word from an array of words</li>
<li>You can hardcode a array of words</li>
<li>Allow the user to give an input of a letter to guess</li>
<li>If the user guesses the wrong letter you should reduce the amount of guesses they have remaining.</li>
<li>It is your choice whether you hardcode how many attempts they have or allow them to choose how many guesses they can have.</li>
<li>If the user runs out of guesses, end the game.</li>
<li>Allow the user to see the letters they have guessed correct and the letters that are remaining. Something like:
Your word : ***i**i*s
</ul>
